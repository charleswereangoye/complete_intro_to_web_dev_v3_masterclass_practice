# Frontend Masterclass Exercises

This repository contains exercises and projects completed as part of the **Frontend Masterclass** course. The exercises are intended to strengthen my frontend development skills, covering topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and interactive web interfaces.

Although I completed this course as part of my studies at **African Leadership University**, this repository serves as a personal collection of hands-on practice exercises to showcase my frontend development journey.
